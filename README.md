# MageBattleTriJam

Quick little game I made for the TriJam game jam (3 hours of development).

The goal is to see how many times you can defeat the evil wizard. Enjoy!

The assets were mostly free online and I did not count searching for assets or design toward my final time. Most of the 3 hours was spent coding or building the scene. If I'm being honest I'd probably add this up to about 3.5 hours since I ripped a few pieces of code from another project of mine.

Controls
